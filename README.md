## Project Description

## Metrics

**The metric of success is, of course, money** 💲💰💲💰💲

* Our assignment is to estimate the price of Rick’s 5,000 diamonds achieving the smallest amount of error, so he can sell them properly.

* We will specifically measure the **root mean squared error (RMSE)** of our predictions.

* Rick’s goal is to obtain an average error **900 dollars**.
